********************

hipDNN (Deep Neural Network) is a graph-based deep learning library that enables multi-operation fusion for improved performance on AMD GPUs.
Each plugin implements specific operations with support for different datatypes, layouts, and features.
hipDNN allows developers to run deep learning workloads on AMD GPUs by providing an interface modeled after the cuDNN frontend API.

The component public repository is located at `https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/hipdnn <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/hipdnn>`_.

.. note::

  hipDNN is in beta. Running production workloads is not recommended.
