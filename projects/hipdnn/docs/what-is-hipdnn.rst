******************
What is hipDNN?
******************

hipDNN (Deep Neural Network) is a graph-based deep learning library that enables multi-operation fusion for improved performance on AMD GPUs. 
It uses operation graphs as an intermediate representation to describe computations, allowing different backend engines to optimize and execute these graphs efficiently.

hipDNN allows developers to run deep learning workloads on AMD GPUs by providing an interface that matches established deep learning library conventions.

hipDNN has a plugin-based architecture which allows advanced users to extend hipDNN without modifying the core library.

Features
========

- **Graph-based API**: Operations are expressed as computational graphs rather than individual function calls, enabling optimization opportunities.
- **Plugin architecture**: Backend kernel engines are implemented through plugins, allowing extensibility without modifying the core library.
- **Performance through fusion**: Multiple operations can be fused into single kernels for better performance.
- **Engine selection**: Heuristics will be implemented as plugins, allowing extensibility without modifying the core library, and benchmarking will be implemented as an extensible frontend API allowing customized engine selection logic.
- **Industry standard API**: Provides a familiar interface that matches established deep learning library conventions.

Components
==========

- **Frontend**: A header-only C++ library that provides the industry standard API for interacting with hipDNN. The frontend wraps the backend C API to provide a more user-friendly C++ interface.
- **Backend**: A shared library which provides a C API for hipDNN. The backend is the core component of hipDNN which acts as a plugin loader and manager, connecting problems to engines (provided via plugins) that can solve them.
- **SDKs**: Header-only libraries that provide shared utilities and interfaces. hipDNN provides three SDKs: Data SDK (graph schemas and data structures), Plugin SDK (plugin API and utilities), and Test SDK (testing utilities and CPU reference implementations).
- **Plugins**: Plugins provide additional operational support or performance improvements.

Engine provider plugins
=======================

hipDNN operations are implemented through provider plugins. Each provider plugin provides its own set of supported operations. See :ref:`plugin-support` for more information.
