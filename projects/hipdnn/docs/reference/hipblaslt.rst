************************************
hipBLASLt provider operation support
************************************

The hipBLASLt provider plugin provides integration with AMD's `hipBLASLt library <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipBLASLt/en/latest/index.html>`_ that provides optimized GEMM operations.

Operation support
=================

The hipBLASLt Provider plugin supports stand-alone Matmul (GEMM, general matrix multiplication) operations with these features and constraints:

- Input and output data types: **FP32**: Single-precision floating point (32-bit), **FP16**: Half-precision floating point (16-bit), and **BFP16**: Brain floating point (16-bit).
- Compute data type: FP32.
- Transposed inputs: Supported.
- Batched matmuls: Only equal batch sizes are supported, or broadcasting when one input has a single batch (batch=1).
- Fused operations: Matmul supports fused bias, forward activation (ReLU, clamp, GELU with tanh approximation, and Swish with unit beta), and fused bias + forward activation (same supported activations).
